# Foot Detection Issue - Resolution Summary

## üêõ Original Issue

**Problem**: Missing feet points in landmark detection  
**Reported**: "We are missing the feet points."

**User Feedback**: "The feet are not being detected properly. The pair of feet should be approximately equally spaced apart from the nose to tail exit axis, not overlapping in the center."

**Additional Requirements**: "They should also be between the nose and tail exit points somewhere. And each pair should be approximately equidistant from both the nose and tail exit points."

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### **Fundamental Algorithm Issue**

The original foot detection algorithm had a **conceptual error** in its approach:

#### **‚ùå INCORRECT Original Logic**

```javascript
// STEP 2: Feet should be CLOSER to the axis than ears
const footThresholdIndex = Math.floor(sortedByDistance.length * 0.6);
const maxFootDistance = sortedByDistance[footThresholdIndex].distanceFromAxis;

// STEP 3: Filter for vertices CLOSE to axis
const footCandidates = vertexDistances.filter((v) => {
  const closeToAxis = v.distanceFromAxis <= maxFootDistance; // ‚ùå WRONG!
  return closeToAxis && onVentralSide;
});
```

**Problem**: This looks for vertices **CLOSE to the nose-tail axis**, which finds vertices near the center line, causing feet to "overlap in the center."

#### **‚úÖ CORRECT New Logic**

```javascript
// STEP 3: Find lateral extremes (vertices FAR from the axis)
const sortedByDistance = [...vertexDistances].sort(
  (a, b) => b.distanceFromAxis - a.distanceFromAxis
);
const lateralExtremeIndex = Math.floor(sortedByDistance.length * 0.2);
const minFootDistance = sortedByDistance[lateralExtremeIndex].distanceFromAxis;

// STEP 4: Filter for vertices FAR from axis (lateral extremes)
const footCandidates = vertexDistances.filter((v) => {
  const isLateralExtreme = v.distanceFromAxis >= minFootDistance; // ‚úÖ CORRECT!
  return isLateralExtreme;
});
```

**Solution**: This looks for vertices **FAR from the nose-tail axis** (lateral extremes), which finds the actual feet positioned away from the center.

### **Missing Anatomical Constraints**

The original algorithm also lacked proper anatomical positioning:

#### **‚ùå INCORRECT Positioning**

- Used simple "front/back" division at 50% along axis
- No constraint for feet to be between nose and tail
- No equidistance validation

#### **‚úÖ CORRECT Positioning**

- **Body region**: Only vertices between 15-85% along nose-tail axis (excluding extremes)
- **Front feet region**: 30-60% along axis (closer to nose)
- **Back feet region**: 40-70% along axis (closer to tail, with overlap for flexibility)
- **Equidistance validation**: Ensures left/right pairs are symmetric

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### **Complete Algorithm Rewrite**

**Replaced** the entire `findFootTips` method with a **lateral extremes algorithm**:

#### **New Algorithm Steps**:

1. **Filter Body Region**: Only vertices between nose and tail (15-85% along axis)
2. **Calculate Lateral Distances**: Distance from each vertex to the nose-tail axis
3. **Find Lateral Extremes**: Top 20% of vertices furthest from axis
4. **Determine Ventral Direction**: Which direction feet extend (up/down)
5. **Filter Ventral Candidates**: Lateral extremes that extend ventrally
6. **Define Foot Regions**: Front (30-60%) and back (40-70%) regions along axis
7. **Separate by Region/Side**: Four quadrants (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right)
8. **Select Most Lateral**: Most extreme lateral candidate in each region
9. **Validate Symmetry**: Ensure left/right pairs are approximately equidistant

### **Key Algorithm Changes**

| **Aspect**             | **Before (Incorrect)**            | **After (Correct)**                            |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Distance Criterion** | Close to axis (‚â§ 60th percentile) | Far from axis (‚â• 80th percentile)              |
| **Sort Order**         | Ascending (closest first)         | Descending (furthest first)                    |
| **Body Region**        | 20-80% along axis                 | 15-85% along axis                              |
| **Foot Regions**       | Simple 50% front/back split       | Anatomical regions (30-60% front, 40-70% back) |
| **Selection Method**   | Closest to nose                   | Most lateral (furthest from axis)              |
| **Validation**         | Distance to nose consistency      | Axial symmetry and lateral balance             |

### **Expected Results**

With the corrected algorithm, feet should now:

1. **‚úÖ Be positioned laterally** (away from center axis, not overlapping)
2. **‚úÖ Be between nose and tail** (not at the extremes)
3. **‚úÖ Be approximately equidistant** from both nose and tail exit points
4. **‚úÖ Show proper spacing** between left and right feet
5. **‚úÖ Maintain anatomical consistency** (front feet forward, back feet back)

## üß™ Validation Points

### **Console Output to Look For**

```
üîç STEP 3: Finding lateral extremes (vertices FAR from axis)...
Minimum foot distance from axis: [distance] (top 20% lateral extremes)
üîç STEP 6: Defining foot regions based on equidistance...
Front foot region: [start] to [end]
Back foot region: [start] to [end]
Front Left foot selected: distance from axis=[distance], axialPos=[position]
‚úÖ Front feet are well-positioned and symmetric
```

### **Visual Verification**
